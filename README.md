SIMON memory game

This project was aiming to replicate the electronic game Simon, which tests memory, as a browser game. It is implemented using JS, HTML, and CSS. 

The front-end has most of the aspects needed. The backend works according to the basic rules of the Simon game.

In the future I aim to add sounds, better styling and other modes of play.

The visual representation of the game captures the idea but could be neater. The Javascript very likely can be shorter and more efficient, and have more handling of "corner-cases".
