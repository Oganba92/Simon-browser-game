SIMON memory game

This project was aiming to replicate the electronic game Simon, which tests memory, as a browser game. It is implemented using JS, HTML, and CSS. 

The front-end has most of the aspects needed. The backend still needs some work.

In the feature I aim to add sounds and other modes of play.
